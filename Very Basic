=================== 01. How many Data Types are there in Solidity? What are the differences among them? =============================

bool              -Boolean		true/false
int/uint          -Integer		Signed and unsigned integers of varying sizes.
int8 to int256    -Integer		Signed int from 8 bits to 256 bits. int256 is the same as int.
uint8 to uint256  -Integer		Unsigned int from 8 bits to 256 bits. uint256 is the same as uint.
fixed/unfixed     -Fixed Point Numbers		Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.
fixed/unfixed     -Fixed Point Numbers		Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.
fixedMxN          -Fixed Point Numbers		Signed fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the 
address           -address holds the 20 byte value representing the size of an Ethereum address. An address can be used to get the balance using .balance method and can be used to transfer balance to another address using .transfer method.


=================== 02. How many types of Variables are there? Differences/Advantages among State, Local, and Global Varibale? Where data of local variables are stored? =============================
State Variables − Variables whose values are permanently stored in a contract storage.
Local Variables − Variables whose values are present till function is executing.
Global Variables − Special variables exists in the global namespace used to get information about the 


=================== 03. What is Visibility Private, Public and Internal? ==========================================
Public: Public variables are accessible both within the contract and from external contracts. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for public state variables.
Private: Private variables are only accessible within the contract where they are defined. They remain hidden from derived contracts or external contracts.
Internal: Internal variables are accessible within the contract where they are defined and also from derived contracts. However, they are not accessible from external contracts.
External: External functions can only be called externally (from outside the contract). They cannot be accessed within the contract itself.
