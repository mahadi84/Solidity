=================== 01. How many Data Types are there in Solidity? What are the differences among them? =============================

VALUE TYPES:
------------
store their data directly in the memory they own. This means that whenever a value type variable is used in a function argument or assignment,
a copy of the variable is created. There are eight basic value types in Solidity:

int           -Signed integers: These can store both positive and negative whole numbers.(e.g., int8, int256)
                int256(default) store	32bytes of data and  Range	-2^255 to 2^255-1.
unit          -Unsigned integers: These can only store non-negative whole numbers(including 0) (e.g., uint8, uint256) .
               -uint256 can hold values between 0 and (2^256 - 1),  which is a very large number (approximately 1.1579 x 10^77 in decimal).
bool          -These can only be true or false (e.g., 0 or 1).

address       -These represent a 20-byte Ethereum address.(use to Sending and Receiving Ether, Interacting with Other Contracts, Storing Account Information)
                -Addresses are case-sensitive (e.g., 0xAbCdEf1234567890AbCdEf1234567890 is different from 0xabcdEf1234567890aBcDeF1234567890).
                -In Solidity, there are two address types:
                --address: Used for both user addresses and contract addresses.
               --address payable: Specifically used for addresses that can receive Ether.
                >>Example:
                  contract HelloGeeks {
                            address public userAddress;
                            address payable public recipientAddress;
                        
                            function setAddress(address _userAddress, address payable _recipientAddress) public {
                                userAddress = _userAddress;
                                recipientAddress = _recipientAddress;
                            }
                        }

bytes         -Fixed or dynamically sized byte arrays to store raw binary data.
                1.Fixed-Size Byte Arrays (bytesN):
                      Fixed-size byte arrays have a specified length, ranging from 1 to 32 bytes.
                      The notation “bytesN” represents these arrays, where “N” is an integer indicating the length.
                  >>Example:                      
                      contract FixedSizeBytesExample {   bytes32 public fixedData; // Fixed-size array with 32 bytes                      
                          function setFixedData(bytes32 _data) public {   fixedData = _data;  }                      
                          function getFixedDataLength() public view returns (uint256) { return fixedData.length; }
                      }                      
                      ***When you call getFixedDataLength(), it returns the fixed length of the bytes32 array (always 32 bytes).
                2. Dynamic Byte Arrays:
                    --Dynamic byte arrays do not have a fixed length and can change during runtime.
                    --They are simply represented by the “bytes” keyword.
                  >>Example:                   
                    contract DynamicBytesExample {
                        bytes public dynamicData; // Dynamic array                    
                        function setDynamicData(bytes memory _data) public {  dynamicData = _data; }
                    }

                ***I can modify the size of dynamicData as needed. 
                   Remember that dynamic arrays are flexible, while fixed-size arrays provide efficiency when you know the exact data size.

enum(enumerated) -user-defined types that consist of a set of named constant values.
                >Enums provide names for integral constants, making contracts easier to read and maintain.
                >Each value in the enumerated list is called an enum.
                >By default, enums are represented as integers (starting from zero), but you can assign custom values.
              >>Example:
                  enum Department {
                    IT,
                    HR,
                    Finance
                 }
                
     **You can use enums as a way to categorize or label data within your smart contracts. 
       Remember that enums cannot directly serve as keys in mappings


REFERENCE TYPES:
----------------
store data in a separate location in memory and use a reference (like a pointer) to access that data. 
This means that multiple variables can refer to the same data location.expand_more Reference types in Solidity include:

Arrays: These are ordered collections of elements of the same data type.
        Example: can add values to dynamicArray using pushValue() and retrieve them using getValue().
        contract ArrayExample {
              uint256[] public dynamicArray; // Dynamic array
          
              function pushValue(uint256 value) public {
                  dynamicArray.push(value); // Append to the array
              }
          
              function getValue(uint256 index) public view returns (uint256) {
                  return dynamicArray[index];
              }
          
              function getLength() public view returns (uint256) {
                  return dynamicArray.length;
              }
          }


Strings:  --Is a sequence of characters encoded in UTF-8.
          --It can contain any Unicode character and has no fixed size, meaning it can grow dynamically as needed.
          --I can define a string variable like this: string public myVariable = "Hello World";
          --I can initialize a string by directly assigning a value or passing it to a function.
            >>Example:
              contract StringExample {
                  string public text;              
                  constructor() { text = "Hello, Solidity!"; }              
                  function setText(string memory newText) public { text = newText;}
              }

Structs: is a user-defined data structure that allows you to group together related variables of different types. 
         -Think of it as a way to bundle multiple variables into a single unit. Here’s how you can use structs:
         -Defining a Struct:
          ------------------
        - I create a struct by specifying its properties (fields) and their data types.
                  contract Todos {
                      struct Todo {
                          string text;
                          bool completed;
                      }
                  }

                  >>Accessing Struct Properties:
                    ----------------------------
                  I can access individual properties of a struct using dot notation.
                  >>Example:
                  function get(uint256 _index) public view returns (string memory text, bool completed) {
                      Todo storage todo = todos[_index];
                      return (todo.text, todo.completed);
                  }

Mappings: These are key-value pairs where the key can be of any data type (except for mappings) and the value can be of any data type.
          >>Example: mapping(keyType => valueType) mappingName;
           >>Common use cases:
            Associating data with user addresses (e.g., storing user balances, scores).
            Implementing voting systems (e.g., tracking votes for each candidate).
            Representing complex relationships between data points.
            
          >>Things to remember:            
            Mappings are not iterable, meaning you can't loop through them directly like arrays.
            Accessing a non-existent key returns the default value for the value type (e.g., 0 for numbers, empty string for strings).
            Mappings are stored permanently on the blockchain unless deleted.

Contract types: These refer to other Solidity contracts.

=================== 02. How many types of Variables are there? Differences/Advantages among State, Local, and Global Varibale? Where data of local variables are stored? =============================
State Variables − Variables whose values are permanently stored in a contract storage
Local Variables − Variables whose values are present till function is executing.
Global Variables − Special variables exists in the global namespace used to get information about the 


=================== 03. What is Visibility Private, Public and Internal? ==========================================
Public: Public variables are accessible both within the contract and from external contracts. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for public state variables.
Private: Private variables are only accessible within the contract where they are defined. They remain hidden from derived contracts or external contracts.
Internal: Internal variables are accessible within the contract where they are defined and also from derived contracts. However, they are not accessible from external contracts.
External: External functions can only be called externally (from outside the contract). They cannot be accessed within the contract itself.

=================== 04. What is Array and how it work? how to define Array Push? =============================
Fixed-size arrays: Declared with a specific size.
uint[5] fixedArray;  // An array of 5 unsigned integers

Dynamic arrays: Declared without a specific size.
uint[] dynamicArray;  // A dynamic array of unsigned integers

dynamicArray.push(1);  // Adds 1 to the array
dynamicArray.push(2);  // Adds 2 to the array




=================== 05. How does IF...ELSE statement work? How to define a Tenary operator? =============================
contract IfElseExample {
    function checkValue(uint value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        if (value < 10) {
            return "Value is less than 10";
        } else if (value == 10) {
            return "Value is 10";
        } else {
            return "Value is greater than 10";
        }
    }
}
---
contract TernaryOperatorExample {
    function getValue(uint value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value < 10 ? "Less than 10" : "10 or greater";
    }
}
=================== 06. FOR Loop =============================
contract ForLoopExample {
    function sumOfNumbers(uint n) public pure returns (uint) {
        uint sum = 0;
        for (uint i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

=================== 07. How to define CONSTRUCT() ==========================================================
contract Token {
    string public name; // State variables
    constructor(string memory _name) {
        name = _name;
    }
}
=================== 08. How to return multiple values? ============================================
contract StructReturnExample {

    struct Person {     // Define a struct
        string name;
        uint age;
    }

    function getPerson() public pure returns (Person memory) {     // Function that returns a struct
        return Person("Alice", 30);
    }

    function useReturnedStruct() public pure returns (string memory, uint) {      // Function that uses the returned struct
        Person memory person = getPerson();
        return (person.name, person.age);
    }
=================== 09. Difference among Required, Revert, and Assert? =============================
Require Function: Enforces conditions that must be true for the function to proceed.
  >>Behavior:
    If the condition is true, the function continues execution.
    If the condition is false, the transaction is reverted. This means any state changes made within the function are undone, and the user gets refunded for the gas used up to that point.
    Provides an error message for debugging purposes.
  >>Use Cases:
    Input validation (e.g., ensuring positive values)
    Enforcing state invariants (e.g., user balance check before transfer)
    Access control checks (e.g., verifying sender address)
            Example:
               uint public value;
              function setValue(uint _newValue) public {
                // Enforce that the new value is greater than 0
                require(_newValue > 0, "New value must be greater than 0");
                value = _newValue;
              }

Revert: Can be used for general-purpose error handling.
        if (balance[msg.sender] < amount) {  revert("Insufficient balance"); }

Assert: Used for internal error checking and assumptions that should never be false in a well-written contract.

=================== 10. Difference between views and pure Function in solidity? =============================
VIEW: functions when you need to read data from the contract's storage(State Variables, Modifiers or Gas Consumption) without modifying it (e.g., getting a user's balance).
     -- In this example, getResult() calculates the product and sum of two unsigned integers without modifying any state
            contract Test {
          uint num1 = 2;
          uint num2 = 4;
      
          function getResult() public view returns (uint product, uint sum) {
              product = num1 * num2;
              sum = num1 + num2;
          }
      }
      
PURE: functions for calculations that only rely on the provided inputs and don't interact with the blockchain at all (e.g., mathematical operations or string manipulation).
      --Here, getResult() performs calculations based solely on local variables, making it a pure function
      contract Test {
    function getResult() public pure returns (uint product, uint sum) {
        uint a = 1;
        uint b = 2;
        product = a * b;
        sum = a + b;
    }
}
