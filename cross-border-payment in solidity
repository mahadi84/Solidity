Scenario: Imagine a system where users can send and receive payments across borders without relying on traditional financial institutions.

User Registry: A mapping can store user information like unique IDs (keys) and their corresponding wallet addresses (values). This allows identifying users within the system.
Payment Channels: Another mapping can track ongoing payment channels between users (unique identifier for the channel as key). The value can be a struct containing details like:

Sender Address (address)
Receiver Address (address)
Total Allowed Amount (uint256)
Amount Sent (uint256)
Code Snippet (Example):

-------------------: CODE :-------------------
Solidity
// User Registry Mapping
mapping(uint256 => address) public userRegistry;

// Payment Channel Mapping
struct PaymentChannel {
  address sender;
  address receiver;
  uint256 totalAllowed;
  uint256 amountSent;
}

mapping(uint256 => PaymentChannel) public channels;

// Function to create a payment channel
function createChannel(address payable receiver, uint256 allowedAmount) public {
  uint256 channelId = block.number; // Replace with unique identifier generation
  channels[channelId] = PaymentChannel(msg.sender, receiver, allowedAmount, 0);
  // Register user IDs if not already registered
  if (userRegistry[msg.sender] == address(0)) {
    userRegistry[userId] = msg.sender;
  }
  if (userRegistry[receiver] == address(0)) {
    userRegistry[userId] = receiver;
  }
}

// Function to send payment within a channel
function sendPayment(uint256 channelId, uint256 amount) public {
  PaymentChannel storage channel = channels[channelId];
  require(channel.sender == msg.sender, "Only sender can call this function");
  require(channel.amountSent + amount <= channel.totalAllowed, "Insufficient funds in channel");
  channel.amountSent += amount;
  // Logic to transfer funds (off-chain or on-chain depending on implementation)
}


--------------------------: Explanation :------------------------

The userRegistry mapping stores user IDs and their wallet addresses.
The channels mapping stores details of ongoing payment channels.
The createChannel function creates a new channel with a unique ID, sender, receiver, allowed total amount, and initial sent amount (0).
The sendPayment function allows the sender to send funds within a channel, updating the amountSent value.
Note: This is a simplified example. A real-world system would involve additional functionalities like:

Secure communication between parties involved in the payment channel.
Dispute resolution mechanisms in case of disagreements.
Integration with oracles to obtain exchange rates for cross-border transactions.
Implementation of on-chain or off-chain fund transfer depending on the chosen approach.
